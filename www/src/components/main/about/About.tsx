I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from California
Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, CA in 2021 and began my
professional career as a software developer working at Amazon.

   `
When I was 6 years old, my older brother Zane handed me his GameBoy Color,
sparking an unprecedented fascination with technology which has yet to fade.
By the time I was 14, I was playing with numerous operating systems,
experimenting with any software I could get my hands on, and building
computers for fun.
   `,
   `
I've been developing software for school, work, and fun ever since I wrote my first
"Hello, World!" program in 2015 and wouldn't have it any other way.

I started teaching myself how to play guitar in 2015 and I'm always learning
how to play new songs. I love playing the blues and Jimi Hendrix is my all time
favorite guitarist.
`,
   'Programming': `
In addition to being my profession, I have the privilege of calling
programming a hobby of mine. I love staying up to date with current
technologies and practices in the software development space and I'm constantly
developing new personal projects.
`,
   'Video Games': `
For better or for worse, my older brother handing me that GameBoy marked the
beginning of my time as a gamer. From PokÃ©mon, RuneScape, and World of Warcraft,
to Call of Duty and Battlefield, I've spent thousands of hours throughout my life
playing games like these.
