I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from California
Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, CA in 2021 and began my
professional career as a software developer working at Amazon.

When I was 6 years old, my older brother Zane handed me his GameBoy Color,
sparking an unprecedented fascination with technology which has yet to fade.
By the time I was 14, I was playing with numerous operating systems,
experimenting with any software I could get my hands on, and building
computers for fun.

I've been developing software for school, work, and fun ever since I wrote my first
"Hello, World!" program in 2015 and wouldn't have it any other way.

I started teaching myself how to play guitar in 2015 and I'm always learning

In addition to being my profession, I have the privilege of calling

developing new personal projects.

For better or for worse, my older brother handing me that GameBoy marked the

to Call of Duty and Battlefield, I've spent thousands of hours throughout my life
playing games like these.
